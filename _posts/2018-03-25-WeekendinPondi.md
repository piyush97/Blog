# Weekend in Pondicherry ( Little France in India )

Pondicherry, or Puducherry, is famously known as the French Riviera of the East, and is one of the most mesmerizing and charming places in South India. A former French colony, this quaint little town has retained its old-world French charm. 8000 kilometers away from France, Pondicherry comes very close to giving you a feel of the French culture and the French influence is very obvious in the city right from the food to the architecture.

I spent a weekend in Pondicherry and had an incredible time. It was a very impromptu trip.

# Where I stayed?

Le Mirage is a hidden gem in a quiet part of White Town (The French quarter of Pondicherry).

# What I saw?

1. Matri Mandir (Auroville City) 
  ```quote
  Auroville is a peaceful and tranquil area, a few kilometers from the main town of Pondicherry.
  It is an experimental township with the purpose of realizing human unity.
  Auroville is kind of a hippie paradise and gives you the feel of Goa.
  ```

2. Rock Beach and Promenade

5. Serenity Beach
```quote 
Serenity Beach has a Bazaar on weekends on East Coast Road. Some of the items sold in bazaar are handicrafts, garments and leather goods. 
So it might be a good place to do shopping for all the shopaholics out there
