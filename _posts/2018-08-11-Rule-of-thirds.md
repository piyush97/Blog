So the journey of thirds starts from Yeshwanthpur railway station, in an Indian railway train with a seat in general compartment.
Never did I know, I'll make so many friends and will see a new world in a train's compartment.
So we begin our journey of thirds from today, that is 8th of August.
We all want a lil mindfulness, and even I am in search of it. So leaving for Puttur via Hassan. Took a train which goes through Hassan because of the charismatic hills hiding the busy karnataka from serene shore of water and happiness.
So my train had to stop because of a diversion in the western ghats railway track.
So took a KSRTC bus. Where I made a friend who is 78 years old and is from kasragoda (Kerala). Back in his time, he used to sell coconuts now he's a stock broker.

Reached up uppinangdy which was around 20 minutes away from the place I had to visit (puttur).

So after a scooter drive to puttur, we had a welcome food by my friend's mom, so the welcome food includes : jackfruit dosa and Holige. 
Drinking water directly from well and playing with kittens made my day.

I even got mesmerised by seeing Arecanut plantation at my friend's home.

Sitting in a silent home with a pleasant background of rain water dropping on the ceiling and the petrichor gave that ecstasy which no city can ever provide you.

Whenever you hear clouds roaring, they switch off the current in the home, lightning prone area, they warned me.
Another way my friend scared me. ðŸ˜‚
Earlier he told that snakes are around us.

So close to nature, this was my first time to sit on the laps of earth.

So in supper aunty made, roti, bhindi, rasam and the best known south indian rice. For rasam and rice, the family taught me how to eat rice with hands.
And trust me, boiled rice never tasted that good.

 So we slept at around 12, at 4 i realized that the kitten was sleeping with me on my bed. I gave her a pat then I slept again.

So morning I woke up around 7, with a fresh rays of morning sun, try to wake us up.

Breakfast was being prepared, it was benne masala dosa with coconut chutney.
After having breakfast we did the dishes, it's a ritual here in their house. I appreciate this practice. Then they did a pooja which is done everyday as a routine.
Religion teaches us a lot and one of the purest thing it teaches is discipline. That's what I felt.

So we visited a temple called, mahalingeshwara know for puttur jatre in April. 
So there's a pond where you'll find pearls there, for which puttur got its name. We had mangalore buns there along with prashadam.

So then we went to chamadka falls, beautiful it was, away from human civilization, no motorable roads take you there, we went there, walking. Not knowing that nature has so many surprises for us. We cooked food there, had Pulav and coffee. Had a papad made up of jackfruit. 
So we sat in the falls and had an amazing time there.
After that we had pakodas made from jackfruit and avalakki (Poha) roasted.


Another day, starting our day with rain again, we went for a pooja and we had a bhramin's meal which made me completely full.
Neither I had space for another bite nor for evening food.
But in evening we had avalakki which wasn't that crispy one, the one with vegetables.
Then we watched photos and had a family time.
Night, at supper we had rasam, rice, and lil more tasty south indian food.
 And we slept lil early today, we all got so lethargic after eating that bhramin's food.

Another day starts with rain, but for breakfast we had noodles made up of rice with sambhar.
Then we went to cashew factory and got a chance to see how they process the cashews.
In lunch we had sambhar, rasam (Made up of Kokum) and payasam made up of jackfruit with rice.
I took a quick nap and we went to Campco chocolate factory, where we got to know that NestlÃ©'s chocolate are made up here.
We went inside, no cameras were allowed. It was an amazing experience to taste chocolates while it was being made.
Then again we headed back to home.

We caught a train to Bangalore at 10:10PM, It was again a general, but a smelly one. Controlling my Olfactory Perception, I slept and A NEW MORNING, A NEW CITY.
