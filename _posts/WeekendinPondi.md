# Weekend in Pondicherry ( Little France in India)

Pondicherry, or Puducherry, is famously known as the French Riviera of the East, and is one of the most mesmerizing and charming places in South India. A former French colony, this quaint little town has retained its old-world French charm. 8000 kilometers away from France, Pondicherry comes very close to giving you a feel of the French culture and the French influence is very obvious in the city right from the food to the architecture.

I spent a weekend in Pondicherry and had an incredible time. It was a very impromptu trip.

# Where I stayed?

Le Mirage is a hidden gem in a quiet part of White Town (The French quarter of Pondicherry).

# What I saw?

## DAY 1
1. Matri Mandir (Auroville City) ![Matri Mandir](https://preview.ibb.co/gFBgKn/IMG_7824.jpg)
  ```Auroville is a peaceful and tranquil area, a few kilometers from the main town of Pondicherry. It is an experimental township with the purpose of realizing human unity. Auroville is kind of a hippie paradise and gives you the feel of Goa.```

2. Rock Beach and Promenade

``` Baker street is one of the finest Bakery I've ever been to. From croissant to Coffee, you get everything which can ever make you drool```

4. SVARAM- A Paradise for Music and Sound Lovers (Sound Trippin)
``` This place will always have a special place in my heart. The hand made musical instruments gave us a ravishing and soothing feeling. It was a Musical therapy which relaxed our minds.```
