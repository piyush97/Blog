My college life started in 2016 August. Got a bulk of friends, some stayed and some not.
And one of them is Bhavya. Ever since we met, we make sure that we go out to have some frolic time in this busy college life.

So this day, ie. on 1st of June 2018, we decided to go to Smaash.
[Smaash](https://smaaash.in/) is located in MG road, Bangalore.
So there we had a game of Indoor Cricket.
