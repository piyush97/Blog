### You must be wondering who I am, if you know me then you must be thinking Why I am like this?
Long time back when I was in 1st standard and my big sista (Preeti)[https://instagram.com/npreetii] was is 9th standard.
Yeah well it's a big gap between both of us!
So it was her birthday and Daddy gifted her a petium 2 computer.
I was quite fascinated by the gigantic machine! It was the first time I saw a TV on a big horizontal box (Cabinet of the CPU).
My Sister used to work on it like it's a precious jewel, and I was not allowed to touch it. But as I was a little devil, I was finding ways to access that TIME Machine!
